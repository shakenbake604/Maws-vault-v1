## Notes
- Add a "Reference" tab. A place to keep language references, prophecy lists, random inspiration and other miscellaneous story references.
- Add a "Scenes" tab. Somewhere to write scenes that might not fit in a chapter I'm working on,  somewhere to track those  and link them to Characters, Locations, Events, Groups e.t.c .
- Add a "Chapters" tab. This feature should flow with the other story entities consider characters, locations ,events, items, groups, Consider the user experience with the current features. Brainstorm a robust chapter feature consider backwards compatibility for already existing entities and the ability to retroactively add them to chapters.
- Implement multiple books in one story
